## Contributing code
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. If you want to contribute your code:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Issue that pull request!

Please make sure to keep a consistent coding style, and just reach out to the maintainers if you have questions or suggestions.

    - Where the issue was observed?
    - What OS, browser or device were you using?
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be as specific as possible.
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
